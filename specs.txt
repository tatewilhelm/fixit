Fixit!
"Fixit! Damnit!"

Fixit! is an application used to track repair of devices, quotes, progress, available parts, 
and other things for small scale repair companies.

Fixit! is a flutter based application that runs on mobile (iPad and other tablets), desktop, and web (if possible).

Fixit! stores information on a human readable Google Sheet, or a locally stored spreadsheet. This is so that:
1. Fixit! data is not lost if Fixit doesnt run anymore.
2. Fixit! is not required to update information
3. Fixit! data is extremely portable
4. Security is ez

Fixit keeps track of every repair and the following information:
- Customer Info / Contact (name, phone number, email, etc)
- Device Info (Device info is elaborated on later)
- Problem Description
- Parts needed / used (parts/inventory are elaborated on later)
- Repair Completion status (Not started, waiting on parts, working, finished)
- Quotes / Estimates
- Actual Price
- Amt Paid / Owed (as well as generating invoices)

It also keeps track of types of devices. So the standard Fixit! Device library will look something like
